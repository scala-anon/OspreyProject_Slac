# GrpcClient: General settings for gRPC clients.
GrpcClient:

  # GrpcClient.hostname: Name of host running Data Platform services.
  hostname: localhost

# GrpcServer: General settings for running gRPC servers.
GrpcServer:

  # GrpcServer.maxMessageSizeBytesIncoming: Limit on incoming gRPC message size in bytes, enforced by gRPC framework.
  incomingMessageSizeLimitBytes: 4096000

# IngestionServer: Settings for the Ingestion server process.
IngestionServer:

  # IngestionServer.port: Network port for Ingestion Service gRPC.
  port: 50051

# IngestionHandler: Settings for the Ingestion Service request handler.
IngestionHandler:

  # IngestionHandler.numWorkers: Number of worker threads used by the Ingestion Service request handler.
  # This parameter might take some tuning on deployments to get the best performance.
  numWorkers: 7

# IngestionBenchmark: Settings for the Ingestion Service performance benchmark application.
IngestionBenchmark:

  # IngestionBenchmark.grpcConnectString: String used for gRPC connection to Ingestion Service including "host:port".
  grpcConnectString: "localhost:50051"

  # IngestionBenchmark.startSeconds: Specifies fixed start time for data created by Ingestion benchmark application.
  startSeconds: 1698767462

# QueryServer: Settings for the Query server process.
QueryServer:

  # QueryServer.port: Network port for Query Service gRPC.
  port: 50052

# QueryHandler: Settings for the Query Service request handler.
QueryHandler:

  # QueryHandler.numWorkers: Number of worker threads used by the Query Service request handler.
  # This parameter might take some tuning on deployments to get the best performance.
  numWorkers: 7

  # QueryHandler.outgoingMessageSizeLimitBytes: Limit on outgoing gRPC message size in bytes, applied by query handler.
  # gRPC framework only controls incoming message size, outgoing message size is unlimited, so we are adding this to
  # control the size of messages for query responses.
  outgoingMessageSizeLimitBytes: 4096000

# QueryBenchmark: Settings for the Query Service performance benchmark applications.
QueryBenchmark:

  # QueryBenchmark.grpcConnectString: String used for gRPC connection to Query Service including "host:port".
  grpcConnectString: "localhost:50052"

# annotationServer: Settings for the annotation server process.
AnnotationServer:

  # annotationServer.port: Network port for Annotation Service gRPC.
  port: 50053

# annotationHandler: Settings for the annotation Service request handler.
AnnotationHandler:

  # annotationHandler.numWorkers: Number of worker threads used by the annotation Service request handler.
  # This parameter might take some tuning on deployments to get the best performance.
  numWorkers: 7

# Export: Settings for the export mechanism.
Export:

  # serverMountPoint: Target base directory mounted to machine running Annotation Service for export output files.
  # Setting must be specified to use the export feature.  Export requests will return an error response if not specified.
  # E.g., "/opt/dp/export".
  serverMountPoint: /tmp

  # shareMountPoint: Client-accessible directory for accessing export output files, if different than serverMountPoint.
  # Defaults to serverMountPoint if not specified.
  # E.g., "/share/dp/export".
  shareMountPoint:

  # urlBase: Optional base URL for accessing export output files.
  # Requires a web-server providing access to files at the specified location.
  # E.g., "https://www.facility.gov/dp/export".
  urlBase: http://localhost:8081

  # tabularExportFileSizeLimitBytes: Specifies size limit in bytes for tabular export output files to avoid potential
  # out of memory issues in the service.  Limit applies to tabular export formats like csv and xlsx because a large
  # table data structure is created in memory before writing the file, but does not apply to bucketed export formats
  # like hdf5, because each bucket is written to file as it is accessed from the database without building
  # in-memory data strcutures.
